What is Bird-Detectors?
***************
Bird-Detectors is a deep learning platform for training and predicting birds on aerial RGB images. We also includes six different datasets which contain manully labeled RGB images collected by our Mavic pro 2 drone from different conservation areas in Missouri. Based on Detecron2, a Facebook AI Research's next generation library, Bird-Detectors include FasterRcnn models pretrained on these datasets. You can also train and predict your own bird datasets with custom models.
